# Test Shopify App Template - Remix

This is a template for testing [Shopify apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) built using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.

This template demonstrates how to use Vitest, Testing Library, and `@remix-run/testing` to test routes and components built with Polaris components.

You can ask questions in the [Discussions section of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/btomaj/shopify-app-template-remix-testing/discussions).

Rather than cloning this repo, you can follow the [quick start steps](#quick-start) to set up your Shopify Remix app with tests. 

You can [preview the route and component tests on Stackblitzâš¡](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/btomaj/shopify-app-template-remix-testing). Once loaded, you can make changes to `/tests/routes/AdditionalPage.test.jsx`, and see the test rerun.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
You must [initialise a Remix app using the Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create).

### Setup
First, change "`@2.0.0`" in the line below to match the version of `@remix-run/react` in your `package.json` file, and run:
```
npm i -D @remix-run/testing@2.0.0
```
Finally, run:
```
npm i -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react vite-tsconfig-paths jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @shopify/shopify-app-session-storage-memory
```

### Route and component testing
1. Copy the `tests` directory to the root directory of your project.
1. Copy the `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.workspace.ts` files to the root directory of your project.
1. From your command line, run `npx vitest` to test routes and components.

## (In)frequently Asked Questions
- What is `@testing-library/polaris`?

  `@testing-library/polaris` is not a real package. It is a Vitest alias and TypeScript path set up in config files for convenience.

- Why are you using Vitest workspaces?

  Vitest workspaces contain the `@testing-library/polaris` alias and the Shopify mocks to the directories with Polaris and Shopify tests.
